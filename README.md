# Robotic Arm Billiard Game

This project is a Robotic Arm Billiard Game, designed to simulate and automate billiard playing using a robotic arm. The system is composed of three main modules: image processing, robotic arm path planning, and robot control.

## Overview

The Robotic Arm Billiard Game project consists of:

1. **Image Processing (Python):** Detects the billiard table, balls, and cue using computer vision techniques.
2. **Path Planning (C++):** Calculates optimal shot trajectories and robotic arm movements.
3. **Robot Control (C++):** Sends commands to the robotic arm to execute the planned shots.

## Python Module: Image Processing

This module is responsible for:

- Capturing images from a camera pointed at the billiard table.
- Processing the images to identify the positions of balls and other important features.
- Outputting data required by the path planning module.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: (To be added: e.g. OpenCV, NumPy, etc.)  

*More details coming soon.*

## C++ Modules: Path Planning & Robot Control

These modules handle:

- **Path Planning:**  
  - Calculating collision-free paths for the robotic arm.
  - Determining the best angles and forces for successful shots.

- **Robot Control:**  
  - Interfacing with the robotic arm hardware.
  - Executing planned paths in real-time.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Language: C++  
- Libraries/Dependencies: (To be added: e.g. ROS, Eigen, hardware SDKs, etc.)  

*More details coming soon.*
